# Go-lang-all-Codes
# Go-lang-all-Codes

This repository contains all the Go language code examples and projects I have written as part of my learning journey in Go (Golang) programming.

## Overview

The goal of this repo is to document and practice Go concepts from basics to advanced topics, covering the core language features, concurrency, and backend development with Go.

## Repository Structure

- `01-basics/` - Basic Go syntax and language constructs (variables, types, control flow, functions)
- `02-data-structures/` - Slices, arrays, maps, structs, and interfaces
- `03-concurrency/` - Goroutines, channels, concurrency patterns
- `04-functions/` - Function types, closures, deferred execution
- `05-error-handling/` - Handling errors in Go
- `06-web-api/` - Examples and projects building RESTful APIs in Go
- `07-database/` - Database connectivity and CRUD operations
- `08-experiments/` - Miscellaneous practice codes and utilities

## How to Use

- Navigate to each folder to find code examples for specific Go topics.
- Each folder contains runnable `.go` files demonstrating key concepts.
- Feel free to clone the repo and run code examples to deepen your understanding.
- Contributions are welcome to extend this learning repository.

## About Me

I am learning Go to strengthen backend development skills and build efficient, concurrent applications. This repository is my ongoing practice and portfolio of code samples.
